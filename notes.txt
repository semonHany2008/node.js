 - using + operator between two strings will concatenate the strings, but using other operators the strings will be implicitly converted into numbers including (NaN)
 - variables declared using let, var, const all are function block, while let and const only are scope block
 - variables are temporarily storing units, unlike the databases. as the variables store its values in RAM, while databases values stored into hard desk.
 - accessing element that is not exist in an array will print undefined.
 - previusly, in concatenation if the very first term was number the operation will be addition else it will be concat
   ,but now whatever the first term type it will be concatenation.
 - while accessing elements in list using bracket-notation we can't use negative indexes,
   ,but using methods like splice() we can use [-1, -2, -3, ...] to access elements from the end.
 - splice method role with list: Add, remove, or replace items in place. Extract part of an array.
 - reassigning a separate element from an array or string doesn't affect the original list, so we use splice() for replacing in list.
 - we use Object.assign(target, source) to take a value copy, because the direct assignment for object is a reference copy any change in the copied one will affect the original.
